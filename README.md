# Beginning API Development with Node.js

Using the same framework to build both server and client-side applications saves you time and money. This book teaches you how you can use JavaScript and Node.js to build highly scalable APIs that work well with lightweight cross-platform client applications. It begins with the basics of Node.js in the context of backend development, and quickly leads you through the creation of an example client that pairs up with a fully authenticated API implementation.

This book balances theory and exercises, and contains multiple open-ended activities that use real-life business scenarios for you to practice and apply your newly acquired skills in a highly relevant context.

We have included over 20 practical activities and exercises across 9 topics to reinforce your learning. By the end of this book, you'll have the skills and exposure required to get hands- on with your own API development project.

## What you will learn

* Quickly get to grips with Node.js and it  Module System.
* Build an Understanding of Asynchronous Programming in Node.js
* Develop scalable and high performing APIs using hapi.js and Knex.js
* Write unit tests for your API to ensure reliability and maintainability.
* Complete a variety of hands-on exercises and activities to broaden your understanding of the concepts.
* Dive into the capstone project by building an API for a legacy application.
